# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

In this section I struggled with remembering the different commands to manipulate the object. It also took me a minute to realize that the two example "posts" array (one being just an array, the other being an array containing objects) weren't linked and didn't work together at all. I mistakenly thought that the two were somehow connected and I couldn't figure out how.

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

I find my note-taking is most effective when I keep a separate Atom file open and write code with comments as I go, rather than using a pen and paper or notepad app. It helps keep my notes in context and makes it easier for me to understand what programming concept I'm actually working to capture.

- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I think I try a mix of both. If the question is easy to articulate but hard to test, I'll lean towards Google. If it's hard to articulate but easy to test, I'll just try it myself first. At least that way I can add some error codes to my search down the road.
